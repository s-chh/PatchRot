**Overview**
- Self-supervised training strategy for vision transformers to learn rich and transferrable features.
- PatchRot rotates images and image patches by 0째, 90째, 180째, or 270째.
- Trains the network to predict the rotation angles of images and image patches via classification.
- Use a buffer between the patches to avoid trivial solutions like edge continuity.
- Pre-train at a smaller size, followed by finetuning at the original size.
- Learn global and patch-level information of images.

## Run commands (also available in <a href="run_cifar10.sh">run_cifar10.sh</a>):
- Run <strong>`main_pretrain.py`</strong> to pre-train the network with PatchRot.
- Next <strong>`main_finetune.py --init patchrot`</strong> to finetune the network.
Below is an example on CIFAR10:

| Method | Run Command |
| :---         | :---         |
| PatchRot pretraining | python main_pretrain.py --dataset cifar10 |
| Finetuning pretrained model | python main_finetune.py --dataset cifar10 --init patchrot |
- For baseline training (random init) use <strong>`main_finetune.py --dataset cifar10 --init none`</strong>
- We used a **DeiT-Tiny transformer** for the experiments and modified the patch size based on the dataset.
   - Details are available in <a href="https://github.com/s-chh/PatchRot/tree/main/config">config</a>
- To change the dataset, **replace cifar10** with the **appropriate dataset**. <br>
   - Cifar10, Cifar100, FashionMNIST, and SVHN will be auto-downloaded.
   - TinyImageNet, Animals10N, and ImageNet100 need to be downloaded, and the path needs to be provided using the "data_path" argument.
